<p><img src="Images/climate.jpg" id="climate" style="width:225px; height:150px;">Climate Change is the defining issue of our time and we are at a defining moment. From shifting weather patterns that threaten food production, to rising sea levels that increase the risk of catastrophic flooding, the impacts of climate change are global in scope and unprecedented in scale. Without drastic action today, adapting to these impacts in the future will be more difficult and costly.</p>

<h2>Causes of climate change</h2>
<h3>Greenhouse effect</h3>
<div style="display:inline-flex;">
  <div style="width: 50%;">
  <ol>
    <li>The atmosphere allows the heat from the Sun (short-wave radiation) to pass through to heat the Earth's surface.</li>
    <li>The Earth's surface then gives off heat (long-wave radiation).</li>
    <li>This heat is trapped by greenhouse gases (eg methane, carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide), which radiate the heat back towards Earth.</li>
    <li>This process heats up the Earth.</li>
  </ol>

<h3>Deforestation</h3>
<p>Cutting of trees on a large scale from a forest is called deforestation. Deforestation is a massive threat to our tropical rainforests, and it affects them on a vast scale. It involves the removal of trees, but the current rate of deforestation is ridiculously high, and it is starting to command more global attention.</p>

<div style="display:inline-flex;">
  <div style="width: 40%;">
  <h4>Effects of deforestation:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Loss of Habitat</li>
    <li>Increased Greenhouse Gases</li>
    <li>Less water in the Atmosphere</li>
    <li>Soil Erosion and Flooding</li>
    <li>Destruction of Homelands</li>
  </ul>

<div id="amazon" style="display:inline-flex;">
  <div style="width: 50%;">
    <p>The Amazon rainforest is the biggest deforestation front in the world and interventions are urgently needed to prevent a large-scale, irreversible ecological disaster. WWF estimates that 27% – more than a quarter – of the Amazon biome will be without trees by 2030 if the current rate of deforestation continues.</p>

<h3>Air pollution</h3>
<p>Certain gases in the atmosphere retain part of the thermal radiation emitted by the Earth's surface after being heated by the sun, this maintains the planet's temperature at a level suitable for the development of life. Human action, however, has increased the presence of these gases in the atmosphere, causing them to retain more heat and to increase the temperature on the planet. This is what we know as global warming as mentioned earlier.</p>
<div style="display:inline-flex;">
  <div style="width: 50%;">
  <p>The main greenhouse gases are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Water vapour</li>
    <li>Carbon dioxide</li>
    <li>Methane</li>
    <li>Nitrous oxide</li>
    <li>Ozone</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Wildfires</h3>
<h4>Effect of climate change on wildfires</h4>
<p>One of the most important ways that climate change can increase the risk of severe fires is by causing vegetation to dry out. When temperatures are warmer than average, rates of evaporation increase, causing moisture to be drawn out from plants on the land. This drying can create “tinderbox conditions” – meaning that, if a fire is sparked, it can spread very quickly over large areas. </p>

<h4>Effect of wildfires on climate change</h4>
<p>Wildfires emit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that will continue to warm the planet into the future. They damage forests that would otherwise remove CO2 from the air. And they inject soot and other aerosols into the atmosphere, with complex effects on warming and cooling.</p>
